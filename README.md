## What is it:
<p> 
  When users want to use their resources in the game, they must bind them and transfer the information to a database.
  This program allows you to listen to the events triggered by the smart contracts of the BRIDGE section and record the exchanges in a database.
  Furthermore, when the user wants to get their assets back on the blockchain, this application will call the appropriate smart contracts to start the release procedure.
  This application is made up of a database, JavaScript management code and smart contracts for interaction with the "BRIDGE".
